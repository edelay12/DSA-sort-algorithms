Sorting books
Imagine that I gave you 20 books to 
sort in alphabetical order. Express this as an algorithm and then implement your algorithm.

if you had 20 books to sort, you could sort them using .sort() method, meaning by placing each book either before or after the current book based
on the position in the alphabet of the first letter of your book title.
